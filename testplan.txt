We tested our code for handling errors in the following ways:
1. Test to see if the uncompressed file exists and is in the same directory
2. Test to see if compressed files already exist
3. Test to see if we have an empty input file
4. Test to see if there are more requested processes/threads than characters to compress
5. Test for non permissive characters and whitespace
